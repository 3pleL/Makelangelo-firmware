A mural drawing robot and a gentle introduction to 3D printing

Makelangelo is a polargraph mural drawing robot.  It is intended to teach students about programming, physics, trigonometry, and electronics in a fun, goal-oriented way.  Makelangelo is scalable: our test models have ranged from 30cm^2 to 300cm^2.

This is one of two github projects.
Makelangelo-firmware is the code in the brain of the robot.
